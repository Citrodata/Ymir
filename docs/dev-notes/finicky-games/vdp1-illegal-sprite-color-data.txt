Games that draw sprites with illegal color data
===============================================

Sonic X-treme
  Draws sprites in RGB 5:5:5 mode containing "illegal" color data (specifically 0x0060, read from VDP1 VRAM at 0x10000).
  The manual states that 0x0000 is the only valid transparent color code and the entire range from 0x0001 to 0x7FFE is
  "invalid", as it is reserved for palette data. In practice, all color data values from 0x0000 to 0x7FFE are considered
  transparent in RGB 5:5:5 mode.
