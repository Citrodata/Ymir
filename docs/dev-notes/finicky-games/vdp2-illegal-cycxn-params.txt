Games that use illegal VRAM access cycle patterns
=================================================

Street Fighter Zero
Street Fighter Zero 2
Street Fighter Zero 3
Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge
Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire
  Sets up two consecutive accesses for NBG0 vertical cell scroll table during intro videos:
    CYCB1 = FFFFCCFF
  This causes every vertical cell scroll fetch for NBG0 to happen twice; the first value is discarded.

Rayman
  Sets up illegal vertical cell scroll fetch timing for NBG1, causing it to be delayed.

Capcom Generation - Dai-5-shuu Kakutouka-tachi 
  Sets up illegal character pattern read cycles for NBG0 bitmap data in VRAM bank B in the image gallery, causing the
  bottom portion of the image (starting at Y=256) to be shifted left. The game compensates for that in VRAM.

Battle Arena Toshinden Remix
  Sets up multiple PN accesses for NBG2 in-game to display UI elements.
