=========================================================
Games that are sensitive to VDP1 and video signal timings
=========================================================

See docs/dev-notes/system-info/vdp1-erase-swap-timings.txt for context.

What to test to verify VDP1 framebuffer erase and swap timings:
  DragonHeart - Fire & Steel    sprites get corrupted
  I Love Donald Duck            sprites linger on items menu
  IPL boot animation            3D graphics flicker
  Marvel Super Heroes           sprites get corrupted (e.g Shuma Gorath's Chaos Dimension move)
  Panzer Dragoon 1              3D graphics flicker in-game
  PhantasM                      FMVs flicker
  Powerslave/Exhumed            intro video flicker, menus and in-game graphics not rendered/erased every frame
  Sega Ages: After Burner II    VDP2 tiles missing/erased
  Sega Ages: OutRun             VDP2 tiles missing/erased
  Sonic R                       3D graphics garbled on title screen
  Soviet Strike                 3D graphics flicker
  Virtua Cop 2                  3D graphics flicker
  Virtua Fighter 1              3D graphics flicker
  Yellow Brick Road             FMVs flicker

Marvel Super Heroes
  The game requests framebuffer swaps during VBlank OUT, which must be honored on the same line.
  If the swap is delayed, the game may occasionally run SCU DMA transfers while the VDP1 is drawing a frame, resulting
  in corrupted sprites.

-----

Panzer Dragoon 1 (in-game)
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN]  VBE=1 -- expects the erase to happen at this line's HBlank IN
    [VBlank OUT] VBE=0 FCM=1 FCT=1 -- expects the swap to happen at this line's HBlank IN (halfway through)
  Frame 2: nothing
  Frame 3: nothing

If you don't delay VBE and FCM/FCT handling until HBlank, you get flashing VDP1 graphics due to swapping frames too late or erasing frames too early.

-----

Sonic R (during title screen, menus and in-game)
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN]  VBE=1 -- expects the erase to happen at this line's HBlank IN
    [VBlank OUT] VBE=0 FCM=1 FCT=1 PTM=1 -- expects the swap to happen at this line's HBlank IN (halfway through)
  Frame 2: nothing

If you don't delay VBE and FCM/FCT handling until HBlank, you get unsorted, overlapping or flashing polygons.

-----

Virtua Fighter 1 (in-game)
  Always uses VBE=0
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=0 -- sets manual framebuffer erase, held until next frame
  Frame 2:
    [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=1 -- does manual erase then swap

The manual framebuffer erase flag is *not* handled at VBlank IN HBlank IN. It is handled in the next frame just before the framebuffer swap.

-----

I Love Mickey Mouse/Donald Duck
  Always uses VBE=0 PTM=2
  When rendering sprites normally:
    Every frame:
      [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=1 -- does manual swap every frame; screen is cleared by a polygon
  When not rendering sprites (e.g. entering the items menu):
    First frame only:
      [VBlank IN] FCM=1 FCT=0 -- requests manual erase, no swap; screen is erased on next frame

Manual erase does not depend on a swap to occur.

-----

Powerslave/Exhumed (intro FMV)
  Always uses VBE=0
  Frame 1:
    [VBlank IN]  FCM=1 FCT=0 -- requests manual erase, no swap
  Frame 2:
    [VBlank IN]  FCM=1 FCT=0 -- requests manual erase, but doesn't take effect due to a pending manual erase
    [VBlank OUT] FCM=1 FCT=1 -- requests framebuffer swap; happens halfway through the line's HBlank
    [shortly after] PTM=1 -- begins rendering new VDP1 frame
  Frame 3: nothing
