=============================================
Games that set invalid VDP2 window parameters
=============================================

These games specify invalid window ranges according to the official docs.
It would seem as though window coordinates are handled as signed integers.

Panzer Dragoon II Zwei
  Builds line window tables that contain invalid start or end coordinates in Episode 3
    0000 to FFFE -> empty window (all outside)
    FFFE to 02C0 -> full line (all inside)

Panzer Dragoon Saga
  The orange swirling background when entering the player name uses a line window table.
  The bottom half of the table has invalid entries:
    0000 to FFFF -> empty window (all outside)

Snatcher
  Sets up window parameters such that the starting point is greater than the ending point.
  Specifically:
    01FF to 0001 -> empty window (all outside)
    FFFC to 0286 -> full line (all inside)
