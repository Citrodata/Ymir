  The intro FMV is contained in a CD-ROM Mode 2 track with special subheader information that is used by the game to
  split the video and audio tracks -- specifically, they are encoded in the file number field of the subheader.
  The game then sets up two filters:
    00 -> filter by file number = 1 and frame addresses 4DDF to 4F19. Pass = output 0; fail = filter 1.
    01 -> filter by file number = 2 and frame addresses 4DE1 to 4EF1. Pass = output 1; fail = discard.
  With this, the game can process the two streams separately.
  File number 1 contains a 320x184 24bpp @ 30 fps Cinepak video stream.
  File number 2 contains a 32000 Hz, 2 channels, 16-bit signed PCM integer AIFF audio stream at 512 kbps.
  The entire track 2 of the disc is in this format.
