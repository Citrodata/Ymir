==========================================================
Games that create infinite loops in the VDP1 command table
==========================================================

Baroque
  Puts an FMV file into VDP1 VRAM but leaves PTM=2, causing it to process a bunch of invalid and extremely large polygons and sprites.

Funky Fantasy
  Fills VDP1 command table with commands to render the FMV over and over again.
  If not properly cycle-counted, this will cause a massive slowdown on the emulator.

Sega Rally Championship
  Certain menu screens (e.g. Arcade) request a framebuffer swap before the command table is set up in VRAM.
  This results in executing a large number of "blank" commands (draw normal 0x0 sprites) and an infinite loop at some points.

Sonic R
  On the first in-game frame when starting a race, it creates an infinite loop by jumping from command at 0x00060 back to 0x00000
  Does not occur on attract mode races

Virtua Fighter 2
  In the fight intro fly-by where the camera faces the player character then moves back and turns to face the two characters,
  the game renders some VDP1 polygons with extremely large values.
  Vertices must be sign-extended from 13 bits, not 10 bits as the manual states. The game does not properly sign-extend the
  coordinates from 13 to 16 bits, resulting in some extremely large values. Rendering such large polygons causes long freezes.
