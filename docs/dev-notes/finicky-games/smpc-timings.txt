==============================================
Games that require SMPC commands to be delayed
==============================================

Running SMPC commmands instantaneously cause issues with these games:

Akumajou Dracula X
Virtual Hydlide
  Gets stuck on the SEGA logo screen if INTBACK executes instantly

Soukyuu Gurentai
  Doesn't respond to controller inputs if INTBACK executes instantly

===========================================================
Games that require INTBACK peripheral reports to be delayed
===========================================================

Discworld
  Requests an INTBACK 01 08 F0 (both reports, no timing optimization) ~12 lines after VBlank IN.
  Once the INTBACK interrupt is handled (still within VBlank), processes the status report and sends a continue request.
  Expects both reports to be delivered before VBlank OUT. Fails to respond to input otherwise.

Virtua Racing
  Requests an INTBACK 01 08 F0 (both reports, no timing optimization) right at the start of VBlank IN.
  Once the INTBACK interrupt is handled (still within VBlank), processes the status report and sends a continue request.
  Expects the status report to be delivered before VBlank OUT and peripheral reports to be delivered after VBlank OUT.
  The SMPC interrupt handler copies OREG data to a buffer and updates write pointer/counter.
  The VBlank OUT interrupt handler resets the write pointer/counter.
  Fails to respond to inputs otherwise.
