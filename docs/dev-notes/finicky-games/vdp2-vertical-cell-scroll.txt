Games that use VDP2 vertical cell scroll with questionable parameters
=====================================================================

Several Capcom games
  The game enables vertical cell scroll on NBG0 and sets up two read cycles on T0 and T1 during the intro FMVs.
  This causes two entries to be read, discarding the first entry.

Magical Night Dreams - Cotton 2
  On stage 2, the game sets up a read cycle for NBG0 vertical cell scroll on T6 and one for NBG1 on T7, but only enables
  the effect on NBG0, which leads to only NBG0 entries being read.
