Bugs that are actually game bugs and not emulator bugs
======================================================


Battle Monsters
---------------
  The loading screen displays the selected arena then fades to the character portraits with a "VS" text. If the game
  loads data fast enough to skip the transition from arena to fighters (such as when boosting CD read speeds), it gets
  confused and performs the transition in-game, leaving some garbage on the UI layer (NBG2) such as the "VS" text and a
  copy of the fighters' names at the bottom of the screen where the portrait frames are supposed to be.


DoDonPachi
----------
  During initialization the MSH2 overwrites SSH2 code while the latter is running, causing it to jump to the illegal
  instruction handler to recover.
  The MSH2 copies some data from 21xxxx to 601Cxxx in a loop between 200014 and 20001E while the SSH2 is in its typical
  FRT ICI wait loop at 601CC36-601CC3A. The copy overwrites the SSH2 code with invalid instructions.
  The game works normally after the SSH2 recovers.


Hang-On GP (USA)
----------------
  Displays garbage graphics for a few frames before the main menu is presented.
  Also occurs on real hardware.


Keriotosse
----------
  Displays garbage graphics for a few frames right before the title screen.
  Also occurs on real hardware.


Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei
---------------------
  Misaligned sprite vs. NBG windows during level start transitions
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  When starting Episodes with a growing window transition (more evident on 2 and 3, barely on 4, 5 and 7), the sprite
  and NBG windows are misaligned as if the NBG window size calculations are delayed by one frame.
  Also occurs on real hardware.


  Sound corruption during boot up with save data on both System and Cartridge Memory
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  During startup, the game plays an intro video followed by the splash screen.
  If you have a save file in both the system and cartridge memories, the game displays a memory select screen before
  everything else.

  The game uses a routine to load sound data into sound WRAM for each episode that checks which sound bank has been
  loaded to avoid reloading the same bank repeatedly. The portion of memory where the sound bank is loaded is shared
  with the video playback routine.
  
  When you only have one save file, everything works fine: the video plays, then the game loads the sound bank for
  Episode 1, then it goes to the splash screen. In this situation, the Episode 1 song plays flawlessly if you go to the
  Options screen and play it right away.

  When there are two save files, the game loads the bank for Episode 1 to handle sounds in the memory select screen.
  This happens *before* the intro video, which trashes part of the loaded sound bank. The routine still thinks the
  Episode 1 bank is loaded correctly, so when it reaches the splash screen, it doesn't reload the bank. When you go to
  Options and try to play the Episode 1 music, some of the samples are corrupted (such as the cymbal that plays right at
  the beginning).

  The sound bank gets fixed when you play any other Episode music then go back to Episode 1.
  This issue does not happen if you start a new game. It only happens if you boot up the game with a save file in both
  System and Cartridge memory, go straight to Options and attempt to play the Episode 1 song right away.


The Yakyuuken Special: Kon'ya wa 12-kaisen!!
--------------------------------------------
  The character intro FMVs get to the end, freeze, and play audio in an endless loop.
  Also occurs on real hardware.
