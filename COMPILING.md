# Compiling Ymir

Ymir requires [CMake 3.28+](https://cmake.org/) and a C++20 compiler.

The repository includes several vendored dependencies as Git submodules. When cloning, make sure to include the `--recurse-submodules` parameter.
You can also initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive` after a `git clone` or when pulling changes.

Ymir has been successfully compiled with the following toolchains:
- Visual Studio 2022's Clang 19.1.1
- Visual Studio 2022's MSVC 19.43.34810.0
- Clang 14.0.0 on WSL Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (`clang`)
- Clang 15.0.7 on WSL Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (`clang-15`)
- Clang 19.1.1 on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (`clang-19`)
- Apple Clang 17 on macOS 15 Sequoia

The project has been compiled for x86_64 and ARM64 Windows, Linux and macOS platforms.


## Build configuration

You can tune the build with following CMake options:

- `Ymir_AVX2` (`BOOL`): Set to `ON` to use AVX2 extensions (on x86_64 platforms only). `OFF` uses the platform's default instruction set, typically SSE2. ARM64 platforms will always use NEON. Disabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_TESTS` (`BOOL`): Includes the unit test project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_SANDBOX` (`BOOL`): Includes the sandbox project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_YMDASM` (`BOOL`): Includes the disassembly tool project in the build. Enabled by default if this is the top level CMake project.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_IPO` (`BOOL`): Enables interprocedural optimizations (also called link-time optimizations) on all projects. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_DEVLOG` (`BOOL`): Enables logs meant to aid development. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_ENABLE_IMGUI_DEMO` (`BOOL`): Enables the ImGui demo window, useful as a reference when developing new UI elements. Enabled by default.
- `Ymir_EXTRA_INLINING` (`BOOL`): Enables more aggressive inlining, which slows down the build in exchange for better runtime performance. Disabled by default.

For a Release build, you might want to disable the devlog and ImGui demo window and enable extra inlining to maximize performance and reduce the binary size.

It is highly recommended to use [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) as it greatly accelerates the build process, especially on machines with high CPU core counts.


## Building on Windows

To build Ymir on Windows, you will need [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and [CMake 3.28+](https://cmake.org/).
Clang is highly recommended over MSVC as it produces much higher quality code, outperforming MSVC by 50-80%. However, MSVC tends to provide a better debugging experience.

All dependencies are included in the `vendor` directory and are built together with the emulator. No external dependencies are needed.

You can choose to generate a .sln file with CMake or open the directory directly with Visual Studio.
Both methods work, but opening the directory allows Visual Studio to use Ninja for significantly faster build times.


## Building on Linux

To build Ymir on Linux, first you will need to install SDL3's required dependencies. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/linux) to install them.

The compiler of choice for this platform is Clang. GCC is not currently supported as there seems to be a bug which causes it to take an extremely long time to compile `sh2.cpp`.

Use CMake to generate a Makefile or (preferably) a Ninja build script:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```

Pass additional `-D<option>=<value>` parameters to tune the build. See the [Build configuration](#build-configuration) section above for details.

You can use CMake to build the project, regardless of generator:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
```


## Building on macOS

Use CMake to generate a Makefile or (preferably) a Ninja build script:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```

Pass additional `-D<option>=<value>` parameters to tune the build. See the [Build configuration](#build-configuration) section above for details.

You can use CMake to build the project, regardless of generator:

```sh
cmake --build build --parallel
```
